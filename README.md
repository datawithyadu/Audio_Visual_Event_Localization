# Audio-Visual Event Localization (AVE)

Per-second audio-visual event localization on the AVE dataset using a BiLSTM attention network.  
Given a 10-second video clip, the model predicts the event category for every second — 28 event categories + Background.

> Based on: **Tian et al., "Audio-Visual Event Localization in Unconstrained Videos", ECCV 2018**

## Results

All numbers are **mean ± std across 3 seeds** (42, 123, 2024) unless noted.

| Feature source | Audio | Accuracy | Macro Recall | Mean IoU | IoU ≥ 0.5 |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|------------|
| VGG19 self-extracted | real VGGish | 70.00% ± 0.39% | 82.72% ± 1.49% | 80.17% ± 1.17% | 82.01% ± 1.69% |
| R(2+1)D self-extracted | real VGGish | 68.83% ± 1.22% | 80.77% ± 2.00% | 80.41% ± 0.64% | 81.76% ± 0.76% |
| Official h5 (Tian et al.) | VGGish h5 | 66.98% ± 1.14% | 78.19% ± 1.08% | 80.09% ± 0.46% | 82.34% ± 0.25% |
| VGG19 self-extracted | zero (bug) ¹ | 61.27% (n=1) | 73.97% (n=1) | 80.40% | 82.09% |
| R(2+1)D self-extracted | zero (bug) ¹ | 58.45% ± 1.38% | 71.15% ± 1.00% | 81.35% ± 0.08% | 82.92% ± 0.28% |

¹ *Audio was all-zero tensors due to a librosa/ffmpeg PATH bug on Windows — fixed 2026-06-25.*

**Both self-extracted variants (VGG19 and R(2+1)D, with real audio) clearly outperform the official h5 baseline:**
VGG19 leads h5 by +3.0 pp accuracy / +4.5 pp recall; R(2+1)D leads h5 by +1.9 pp / +2.6 pp.
Both gaps exceed the combined noise of the two 3-seed runs, so this conclusion is well-supported.

*VGG19 vs R(2+1)D (self-extracted): the ~1.2 pp accuracy gap between them is smaller than their
combined standard deviation (0.39% + 1.22% = 1.61 pp), so no statistically clear winner between
the two backbones from 3 seeds each — more runs would be needed to distinguish them confidently.*

## Feature Sources

Two feature sources have been fully evaluated:

### 1. Official pre-extracted h5 (paper reference)
Released by Tian et al. alongside [YapengTian/AVE-ECCV18](https://github.com/YapengTian/AVE-ECCV18):
- **Audio**: VGGish embeddings — `data/audio_feature.h5` (42 MB, shape 4143 × 10 × 128)
- **Video**: VGG19 pool5 — `data/visual_feature.h5` (7.7 GB, shape 4143 × 10 × 7 × 7 × 512)

When both h5 files are present in `data/`, the pipeline uses `AVEDatasetH5` automatically.

### 2. Self-extracted .pt features (team exercise)
Extracted from raw `.mp4` files using `feature_extractor.py`:
- **Audio**: VGGish via ffmpeg subprocess → `data/features/audio/<id>.pt` (10 × 128)
- **Video (primary)**: VGG19 pool5 (ImageNet weights, `model.features`) → `data/features/video/<id>.pt` (10 × 49 × 512)
- **Video (archived)**: R(2+1)D-18 → `data/features_r2plus1d_backup/video/<id>.pt` (10 × 49 × 512)

4,097 clips extracted (excludes 46 clips missing mp4 files).

> **Audio extraction note**: The original `librosa.load()` call silently produced all-zero tensors on Windows
> because librosa's audioread backend could not find ffmpeg in the conda env PATH. This was fixed by replacing
> librosa with a direct `ffmpeg` subprocess call (`pcm_s16le` pipe). All 4,097 audio files were re-extracted
> and verified non-zero before the final retraining runs.

**Key design choices**
- **Audio-guided attention**: audio embedding selects relevant spatial regions from 49 video patches
- **Modality dropout** (p=0.1): randomly zeros one modality per batch item to prevent dominance
- **Class-weighted CrossEntropyLoss**: inverse-frequency weights handle 29-class imbalance
- **Gradient clipping** at max norm 5.0 for BiLSTM stability
- 2,111,005 trainable parameters

## Setup

```bash
conda create -n torch_env python=3.10
conda activate torch_env

# PyTorch with CUDA 12.4 (adjust for your CUDA version)
pip install torch==2.6.0+cu124 torchvision==0.21.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.6.0+cu124 \
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install numpy h5py opencv-python scikit-learn

# ffmpeg required for self-extraction audio pipeline (librosa replaced by subprocess)
conda install -c conda-forge "ffmpeg=6.*"
```

**Requirements**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA. For h5 runs: place `audio_feature.h5` and `visual_feature.h5` in `data/`. For self-extraction runs: place `.mp4` files in `data/AVE/`.

---

## Run

### Option A — Official h5 features (paper comparison)
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```
Requires `data/audio_feature.h5` and `data/visual_feature.h5`. Skips extraction automatically.

### Option B — Self-extract then train
```bash
# Step 1: extract features (~12 min audio + ~8–9 hr video on RTX 4050)
python feature_extractor.py

# Step 2: train with self-extracted features (3 seeds × 2 backbones)
python run_real_audio.py
```

### Multi-seed comparison
```bash
python run_multiseed.py   # 3 seeds × h5 vs .pt, saves results_seed_comparison.md (project root)
```
